# Car Analysis Project

This project analyzes the `SASHELP.CARS` dataset using various SAS procedures. The analysis includes:

- **First 10 Observations**: Displaying the first 10 records from the dataset.
- **Summary Statistics**: Calculating mean, standard deviation, min, and max for key variables.
- **Frequency Distribution**: Analyzing the distribution of car types.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigating correlations between numeric variables.
- **Scatter Plot**: Plotting Horsepower vs. MPG (City).

The SAS code is contained in the `car_analysis.sas` file.
